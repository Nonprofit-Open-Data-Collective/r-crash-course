## Introducing R

R is a 30-year-old statistical language created by New Zealand statisticians Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka as a free alternative to proprietary software for their students at the University of Auckland. In fact, its rich lineage can be directly traced to inventor and scientist Alexander Graham Bell.

Watch the video below for a brief introduction to R as it's used today.

## The R Toolkit

In this course we cover the foundations of data programming with the R language. In order to create robust and dynamic analysis we need to use a couple of tools that were built to leverage the power of R and create compelling narratives.

**RStudio** helps you manage projects by organizing files, scripts, packages and output. **Markdown** is a simple formatting convention that allows you to create publication-quality documents. **R Markdown** is a specific version of Markdown that allows you to combine text and code to create data-driven documents.

The following resources will help you get a better understanding of these tools.

## Getting to Know RStudio

RStudio is a graphical user interface (GUI) and integrated developer environment (IDE) that makes it much easier to use R for writing code, importing data, installing packages, and other features.

#### RStudio: A Guided Tour

The following video provides a tour of the RStudio interface and key components for getting started.

* What is RStudio?
* Executing and scripting commands
* Point-and-click and keyboard shorcuts
* Major interface components and features

## Easy Formatting with Markdown

Markdown is a "lightweight", easy-to-learn syntax that allows you to format language with boldface, italicization, bullet points, and more, even when there's no "rich content editor" menu available.  

Websites and applications that support Markdown may surprise you, including:

* Reddit
* GitHub
* RStudio
* OpenStreetMap
* Stack Exchange
* Microsoft Teams
