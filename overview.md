## The R Language

R is a 30-year-old data programming language created by New Zealand statisticians Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka as a free alternative to proprietary software for their students at the University of Auckland. It was modelled after the [S Programming Language]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)'), invented by John Chambers while at Bell Labs. 

The language has evolved and the user community has grown considerably. R and Python are two of the most popular data programming languages used in academics and by professional data scientists. 

R is currently supported by a [large team of contributors](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html), a [Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/), and [thousands of contributed packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/).*

## The R Toolkit

This seminar will cover the foundations of data programming with the R language. To create robust and dynamic analysis we can use a couple of tools that were built to leverage the power of R to create compelling narratives.

* **The R Language** [ [Overview](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/ch-010-core-r.html) ]
* **Packages in R** [ [CRAN Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) ] 
* **RStudio** [ [A Development Environment](https://www.rstudio.com/about/what-makes-rstudio-different/) ] 
* **Markdown** [ [Documentation and Reporting](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/ch-030-data-driven-docs.html) ] 
* **R Markdown** [ [Data-Driven Docs](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/ch-031-markdown.html) ]

## Getting to Know RStudio

RStudio is a graphical user interface (GUI) and integrated developer environment (IDE) that makes it much easier to use R for writing code, importing data, installing packages, and other features.


#### RStudio: A Guided Tour

The following video provides a tour of the RStudio interface and key components for getting started.

* What is RStudio?
* Executing and scripting commands
* Point-and-click and keyboard shorcuts
* Major interface components and features

## Easy Formatting with Markdown

Markdown is a "lightweight", easy-to-learn syntax that allows you to format language with boldface, italicization, bullet points, and more, even when there's no "rich content editor" menu available.  

Websites and applications that support Markdown may surprise you, including:

* Reddit
* GitHub
* RStudio
* OpenStreetMap
* Stack Exchange
* Microsoft Teams

<br>

#### Markdown Basics

The following video provides a brief introduction to Markdown fundamentals.

* Headers & Sub-Headers
* Boldface & Italicization
* Ordered & Unordered Lists
* List Sub-Items & Hyperlinks
