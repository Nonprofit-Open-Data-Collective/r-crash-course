These lectures and research presentations were part of a series sponsored by the Data and Analytics section of ARNOVA. The group was created to support the dissemination and celebration of better data and new research methods by and for the nonprofit research community. 

> Better Data + Better Methods = Better Research 

Most of the content was created by [Jesse Lecy](www.lecy.info) and is available open-source on the [DS4PS site](https://ds4ps.org/) (*Data Science for Public Service*) or the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/DS4PS). 

The R workshop and [research presentations](https://nonprofit-open-data-collective.github.io/r-crash-course/talks/) by varioud ARNOVA members are archived at this site for posterity. 

Special thanks to [Jamison Crawford](https://github.com/jamisoncrawford) for putting together an [excellent YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7qXkCiERSNtT_1IHt_88kQ/featured) with lots of great R resources for beginners.
